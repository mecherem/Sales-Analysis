# Simple Sales Analysis with Python & Pandas

This is my first step into Data Analysis for my AI Engineering journey. 
The project calculates the best-selling product from a raw dataset using the Pandas library.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
* Data manipulation with **Pandas**.
* Using `groupby()` to aggregate repeated data entries.
* Basic Python project structuring.

### 🛠️ How to Run:
1. Install pandas: `pip install pandas`
2. Run the script: `python sales_analysis.py`
